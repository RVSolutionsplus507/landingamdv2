      <p>Find the perfect size for mini storage units you need based on what you store and what you can spend.</p>
      
      <h2>1. Make an inventory</h2>
      <p>Make a list of all the objects you want to store: furniture, appliances, boxes, bulky objects or irregular shapes like bicycles or lamps. This will help you better visualize the necessary space.</p>
      
      <h2>2. Measure what you want to store</h2>
      <p>For large objects, use a tape measure and write down their dimensions. This way you can compare with available measurements and avoid renting a space that is too tight or excessive.</p>
      
      <h2>3. Decide frequency of access</h2>
      <p>If you plan to enter your mini storage unit often, consider leaving space to walk between boxes or objects.</p>
      
      <h2>4. Consider special conditions</h2>
      <p>Are you going to store delicate objects like electronic devices or wooden furniture? A climate-controlled mini storage unit could work. Also check location and access.</p>
      
      <h2>5. Schedule your appointment</h2>
      <p>If you want to have a more precise idea of the space you need, schedule an appointment with us and we will gladly provide you with adequate advice on the perfect mini storage unit for you.</p>

      <p>Follow these valuable tips to keep your clothes and shoes in perfect condition while they are in our storage units.</p>
      
      <h2>1. Clean and dry</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Wash each garment well before storing it. This eliminates invisible stains, sweat or residues that can cause odors or attract insects.</li>
        <li>Avoid using strong bleaches or softeners, they can leave residues that yellow clothes over time.</li>
        <li>Make sure they are completely dry, humidity inside a box can generate mold or bad smell.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>2. Repair before storing</h2>
      <p>A loose button? Something torn? Fix it before packing. This way you'll prevent the damage from getting worse over time. Spending a few minutes sewing saves you double the work later. Your future self will thank you and your clothes will stay in better condition.</p>
      
      <h2>3. Choose well where to pack</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cardboard boxes:</strong> Alternate heavy garments at the bottom, soft ones on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Wardrobe boxes (for hanging):</strong> ideal for dresses, suits, delicate clothing.</li>
        <li><strong>Plastic boxes:</strong> useful against humidity, but don't use them for long because they don't let clothes breathe.</li>
        <li><strong>Fabric bags (linen or cotton):</strong> perfect for delicate clothing like baby clothes.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>4. Control humidity and bad odors</h2>
      <p>Add anti-humidity or silica bags in the boxes to keep the interior dry, between clothes and shoes. They repel insects and leave a good smell.</p>
      
      <h2>5. Clean and dry shoes</h2>
      <p>Wash them, dry them well and put paper or clean socks inside so they don't get flattened.</p>
      
      <h2>6. Preserve the shape</h2>
      <p>Fill shoes with paper so they don't deform. Don't use newspaper, which can stain your shoes.</p>
      
      <h2>7. Classify by type of footwear</h2>
      <p>Store by categories (daily use, occasional, formal, etc.), this way you find quickly what you're looking for and reduce damage.</p>
      
      <h2>Strong containers for shoes:</h2>
      <p>Store shoes in resistant plastic boxes, better if they are transparent so they can be seen without opening. Cardboard boxes get wet easily.</p>

      <p>If you still don't know what things you can store, here we share smart object ideas: save space, optimize order and protect the essential without complications. Keep reading and transform your chaos into efficiency.</p>
      
      <h2>Furniture</h2>
      <p>They are the most common objects in storage: chairs, tables, closets, pictures, lamps, among others. Useful during a remodeling or if you use the space at home during a remodeling or a temporary move. Clean them before storing and cover them with light fabrics or plastics helps avoid dust and scratches.</p>
      
      <h2>Electronic and office equipment</h2>
      <p>Devices that are not used frequently such as televisions, printers, microwaves or computers. It's best to store them in climate-controlled storage units to avoid damage from extreme heat, free up space in your business or home and keep them safe.</p>
      
      <h2>Books, documents and files</h2>
      <p>They are ideal for storing in our storage units: they help free up space, maintain order and preserve what you value most. Just make sure to pack them properly, use cardboard or plastic boxes and you'll have efficient and durable storage, without complications.</p>
      
      <h2>Tools and DIY materials</h2>
      <p>From wrenches and drills to spare parts, mini storage units are perfect for keeping them organized and out of the way.</p>
      
      <h2>Sports equipment and suitcases</h2>
      <p>Bicycles, mats, camping items or suitcases take up space at home, but fit well in storage units, freeing up valuable space.</p>
      
      <h2>Memories or items with sentimental value</h2>
      <p>Photos, albums, old toys, collections or antique furniture. These items have sentimental value, so it's essential to store them in appropriate boxes, protected from heat, humidity or possible scratches.</p>

      <p>Apply these recommendations before storing your things in the storage units to prevent any unexpected eventuality.</p>
      
      <h2>Inventory</h2>
      <p>Make a detailed list of everything you are going to store. This will help you keep control and backup in case of unforeseen events.</p>
      
      <h2>Proper packing</h2>
      <p>Use strong boxes, strong packing tape and bubble wrap for fragile objects.</p>
      <p>Avoid using old or weak boxes that can break when moving them.</p>
      
      <h2>Protect against humidity and dust</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Place anti-humidity bags or absorbents.</li>
        <li>Use plastic covers or blankets on furniture, mattresses and clothes.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Electronics and appliances</h2>
      <p>Disconnect and clean well before storing electronic devices. Store cables separately and label them for easy identification.</p>
      
      <h2>Furniture</h2>
      <p>When storing, disassemble tables, beds or shelves to maximize useful space. Remember to reinforce corners and edges before each piece of furniture with cardboard or foam to guarantee its protection and avoid damage.</p>
      
      <h2>Smart organization</h2>
      <p>Always place the heaviest items at the bottom and the most fragile on top. Try to leave a central aisle to be able to enter and take things out easily.</p>
      
      <h2>Protect your storage unit</h2>
      <p>Limit access to your storage unit exclusively to you or people you fully trust. Sharing your access card with third parties significantly increases the risk of loss or theft of your valuable objects.</p>

      <p>The space problem has become a common challenge where homes and offices are getting smaller. Accumulating belongings not only creates clutter, it also invades our comfort and productivity.</p>
      
      <p>The good news is that there is a solution: renting a mini storage unit.</p>
      
      <p>Below we share the advantages of having a mini storage unit:</p>
      
      <h2>1. You have more space without needing to move</h2>
      <p>Renting a storage unit is like adding an "extra room" to your home or business, without the high costs of moving or expansion. You can store furniture, seasonal clothing, documents or any belongings you don't use daily and thus keep your environment more organized.</p>
      
      <h2>2. Security and peace of mind</h2>
      <p>Storage units have 24/7 security, surveillance cameras and controlled access, it's much safer than leaving them in a makeshift room or at a family member's house.</p>
      
      <h2>3. Your ally in moves and renovations</h2>
      <p>When you move or remodel your home, the storage unit becomes the perfect ally to temporarily store your belongings. This way you prevent them from being damaged by dust, humidity or constant movement.</p>
      
      <h2>4. Flexibility for businesses and small companies</h2>
      <p>Storage units are not just for homes, they are also tools for entrepreneurs and small businesses to store:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>They serve as an inventory center without needing to rent a larger location.</li>
        <li>They allow you to scale space according to the season (ideal for businesses with sales peaks).</li>
        <li>They reduce fixed costs by paying only for the square footage you actually need.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>5. Care of your belongings</h2>
      <p>If you choose climate-controlled storage units, you can store without worrying about heat and humidity. They are ideal for clothing, documents, artwork, electronic equipment or musical instruments, keeping them in optimal conditions for longer.</p>
      
      <h2>6. Better quality of life</h2>
      <p>By freeing up space in your home or office, you gain comfort and even emotional well-being. A clear environment allows you to comfortably enjoy your home and focus on what really matters without the stress of accumulation.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Renting a storage unit is much more than a space solution: it's an investment in security, comfort and quality of life.</strong> Whether you're moving, starting a business, traveling or simply want to regain order in your home, a storage unit gives you the peace of mind of having your belongings protected and always within reach.</p>
