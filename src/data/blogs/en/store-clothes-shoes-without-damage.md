# Store your clothes and shoes without damage

Follow these valuable tips to keep your clothes and shoes in perfect condition while they are in our storage facilities.

## 1. Clean and completely dry

- Wash each garment well before storing it. This eliminates invisible stains, sweat, or residue that can cause odors or attract insects.
- Avoid using strong bleaches or fabric softeners, as they can leave residues that yellow clothes over time.
- Make sure they are completely dry, as moisture inside a box can generate mold or bad odors.

## 2. Repair before storing

A loose button? Something torn? Fix it before packing. This way you'll prevent the damage from getting worse over time. Spending a few minutes sewing saves you double the work later. Your future self will thank you and your clothes will stay in better condition.

## 3. Choose the right packing containers

- **Cardboard boxes:** Alternate heavy garments at the bottom, soft ones on top.
- **Wardrobe boxes (for hanging):** ideal for dresses, suits, delicate clothing.
- **Plastic boxes:** useful against humidity, but don't use them for long periods because they don't let clothes breathe.
- **Fabric bags (linen or cotton):** perfect for delicate clothing like baby clothes.

## 4. Control humidity and bad odors

Add anti-humidity or silica gel packets in the boxes to keep the interior dry, between clothes and shoes. They repel insects and leave a good smell.

## 5. Clean and dry shoes

Wash them, dry them well and put clean paper or socks inside so they don't get crushed.

## 6. Preserve their shape

Fill shoes with paper so they don't deform. Don't use newspaper, as it can stain your shoes.

## 7. Classify by type of footwear

Store by categories (daily use, occasional, formal, etc.), this way you find what you're looking for quickly and reduce damage.

## Strong containers for shoes:

Store shoes in sturdy plastic boxes, preferably transparent so they can be seen without opening. Cardboard boxes get damp easily.
