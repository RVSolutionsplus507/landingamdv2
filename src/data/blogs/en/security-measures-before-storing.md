# Security measures before storing

Apply these recommendations before storing your belongings in storage facilities to prevent any unexpected events.

## Document everything

Before storing your items:

- **Create an inventory list:** Document everything you store with descriptions and approximate values
- **Take photos:** Visual record of the condition of your belongings before storage
- **Keep receipts:** Save purchase receipts for valuable items for insurance purposes

## Proper packing

### Use quality materials
- **Sturdy boxes:** Invest in new, strong cardboard boxes or plastic containers
- **Bubble wrap:** Protect fragile items properly
- **Packing tape:** Use quality tape to secure boxes

### Packing techniques
- **Don't overload boxes:** Keep weight manageable (max 20kg per box)
- **Fill empty spaces:** Use packing paper or bubble wrap to prevent movement
- **Label clearly:** Mark contents and fragility on each box

## Protect valuable items

### Special considerations
- **Electronics:** Wrap in anti-static materials and store in climate-controlled units
- **Documents:** Use waterproof containers or bags
- **Artwork:** Use acid-free materials and proper framing protection
- **Jewelry:** Consider a safety deposit box for extremely valuable pieces

## Insurance coverage

### Review your policies
- **Homeowner's/Renter's insurance:** Check if it covers items in storage
- **Facility insurance:** Understand what the storage facility covers
- **Additional coverage:** Consider extra insurance for high-value items

## Choose the right storage unit

### Climate considerations
- **Climate-controlled units:** Essential for electronics, documents, and sensitive items
- **Humidity control:** Prevents mold and moisture damage
- **Temperature stability:** Protects against extreme temperature fluctuations

### Security features
- **24/7 surveillance:** Ensure the facility has security cameras
- **Access control:** Look for keypad or card access systems
- **On-site management:** Facilities with staff present offer better security

## Regular maintenance

### Periodic checks
- **Visit monthly:** Check on your stored items periodically
- **Inspect for pests:** Look for signs of rodents or insects
- **Check containers:** Ensure boxes and containers remain intact

## Conclusion

Taking these security measures before storing protects your belongings and gives you peace of mind. Proper preparation and choosing the right facility are key to successful long-term storage.
