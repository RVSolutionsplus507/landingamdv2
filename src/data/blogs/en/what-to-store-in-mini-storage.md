# Do you know what to store in a mini storage?

If you are still not clear about what things you can store, here we share ideas for storing objects intelligently: save space, optimize order and protect the essentials without complications. Keep reading and transform your chaos into efficiency.

## Furniture

These are the most common objects in storage: chairs, tables, wardrobes, paintings, lamps, among others. Useful during a renovation or if you use the space at home during a remodel or temporary move. Clean them before storing and cover them with light fabrics or plastics to help avoid dust and scratches.

## Electronic and office equipment

Appliances that are not used frequently such as televisions, printers, microwaves or computers. It's best to store them in climate-controlled storage to avoid damage from extreme heat, free up space in your business or home and keep them safe.

## Books, documents and files

They are ideal for storing in our storage facilities: they help free up space, maintain order and preserve what you value most. Just make sure to pack them properly, use cardboard or plastic boxes and you'll have efficient and durable storage, without complications.

## Tools and DIY materials

From wrenches and drills to spare parts, mini storage units are perfect for keeping them organized and out of the way.

## Sports equipment and luggage

Bicycles, mats, camping items or suitcases take up space at home, but fit well in storage, freeing up valuable space.

## Memorabilia or items with sentimental value

Photos, albums, old toys, collections or antique furniture. These items have sentimental value, so it's essential to store them in appropriate boxes, protected from heat, humidity or possible friction.
