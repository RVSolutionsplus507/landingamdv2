# Choose the ideal size for your mini storage

Choosing the right size for your mini storage can save you money and ensure you have adequate space for all your belongings. Here are some practical tips.

## Evaluate what you need to store

Before choosing a size, make a detailed list of all the items you plan to store. Consider:

- **Furniture**: Beds, sofas, tables, chairs
- **Appliances**: Refrigerators, washing machines, microwaves
- **Boxes**: Documents, clothes, books
- **Seasonal items**: Decorations, sports equipment
- **Vehicles**: Bicycles, motorcycles

## Common mini storage sizes

### Small (1.5m x 1.5m)
Perfect for:
- 10-15 boxes
- Small furniture
- Seasonal clothes
- Documents and files

### Medium (2m x 2m)
Ideal for:
- Contents of a small room
- Small appliances
- 20-30 boxes
- Office furniture

### Large (3m x 3m)
Great for:
- Contents of a 2-bedroom apartment
- Large furniture
- Multiple appliances
- Business inventory

### Extra Large (4m x 4m)
Perfect for:
- Contents of a house
- Vehicles
- Large business inventory
- Long-term storage

## Tips for maximizing space

1. **Use vertical space**: Stack boxes safely, heaviest at the bottom
2. **Disassemble furniture**: Save space by taking apart bed frames and tables
3. **Fill hollow items**: Use drawers and appliances to store smaller items
4. **Leave pathways**: Ensure you can access items in the back
5. **Label everything**: Make finding items easier

## Calculate your needs

A good rule of thumb: estimate the space you need and add 20% extra for easy access and future items.

## Conclusion

Take time to properly assess your storage needs. It's better to have slightly more space than to struggle with insufficient room. Our team can help you choose the perfect size for your specific requirements.
